## Getting started

You can install the client in your project by using composer.

Add the package to the repositories list in the composer file of the project:

```json
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "git",
            "url":  "git@git.combell-ops.net:{{gitUserId}}/{{gitRepoId}}"
        }
    ]
```

And install the package:


```bash
composer require {{packageName}}
```
